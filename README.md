# Water Cycle Simulation

This Water Cycle Simulation project represents an innovative exploration of hydrological processes crucial to sustaining life on Earth. This initiative leverages 3D drawings to provide an immersive and visually captivating experience. Implemented in C++.

## Initiating
To initiate the process, you need to install OpenGL with FreeGLUT and GLEW. Then use the following commands,

```bash
g++ final.cpp -o final -lopengl32 -lglew32 -lfreeglut -lglu32

.\final.exe 
```
